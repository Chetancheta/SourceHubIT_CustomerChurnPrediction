# Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective
This project predicts whether a customer will churn using a machine learning model built with Python. It uses the Telco customer dataset to analyze churn based on factors like tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Features
**Dataset**: Telco_customer_churn.xlsx
- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Performance**: Accuracy with ROC AUC of 0.82
- **Outputs**: 
  - Confusion Matrix (889 true negatives, 203 true positives)
  - ROC Curve (AUC = 0.82)
  - Sample Predictions (e.g., Customer 1: Churn, Customer 2: Not Churn)
    
- Note: Plots (Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve) are displayed in the output.

## Files
